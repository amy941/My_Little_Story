# My_Little_Story

I was born and raised in a small city in Vietnam called Da Nang.
My Dad was a soldier. He went to war… survived… came back… and married my Mom.

When my parents had their first child, my oldest sister Anh, they decided to open a small coffee shop.
Our family's livelihood relied on that little shop. Life wasn’t easy. But honestly? My siblings and I
had the best childhood growing up in Vietnam.

When I was eight, my Dad sat me down and asked, "What do you think about the idea of leaving this town and starting a brand-new life overseas with better education and a brighter future?"
I said "Yes".
Then went right back to my cartoon show and instantly forgot about it.

Fast forward to 10 years, he kept that promise. My life in Canada officially began.
Little did I know, he had gathered every last bit he owned just to make me happy.

We live in a fast-changing digital world, but the only footage I have of him is a 39-second clip filmed by one of my mom’s customers—he’s sitting there, reading the newspaper with his espresso and cigarette on the side.

I often go back to that video whenever I feel lost, whenever I need to remember "why" I'm here.


Me and my siblings are now living the dream life that he once wished upon. Every year, on my birthday, my mom tells me to make a wish, and my wish is always the same. 

I wish, from that far distance, he finally found his peace.
